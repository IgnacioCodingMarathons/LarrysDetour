        Every time it’s your turn, spin the dreidel once. Depending on the side it lands on, you give or get game pieces from the pot.
        If you get [b]Nun (נ),[/b] you don't have to do ANYTHING. You don't get neither give. [i]Unlucky you...[/i]
        If you get [b]Gimel (ג),[/b] you get to take every single token in the pot.
        If you get [b]Hey (ה),[/b]] you get to take half of the pot.
        And, if you get [b]Shin (ש),[/b] you need to put a token in the pot.
        You get a reward for how many tokens you have left. Each token values 5 Bird Coins.
        Happy spinning!"""
